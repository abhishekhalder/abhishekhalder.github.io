</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you <i>really</i> think about something, you <i>usually</i> produce something.
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_E._K%C3%A1lm%C3%A1n">Rudolf E. Kalman</a>
<br /><br />

<li><p>Nothing is more practical than a good theory.

<br /><br />

</p>
</li>
<li><p> One who pursues fame at the risk of losing one's self, is not a scholar.
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi">Zuangzi</a>
<br /><br />

</p>
</li>
<li><p> When you write a paper, you are not only reporting what you did but also teaching your readers how to do what you did. The journey, one might say, is part of the result ... Good cooks leave good recipes.
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malcolmdshuster.com/">Malcom D. Shuster</a>

<li><p> Easy reading is damn hard writing.

<br /><br />

<li><p>
Do not confuse "elementary" with "easy": a proof can certainly be elementary without being easy. In fact, there are many examples of theorems for which a little sophistication makes the proof easy to understand and brings out the underlying ideas, whereas an elementary treatment that avoids sophisticated notions hides what is going on.

<li><p> "When I use a word", Humpty-Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more, nor less".
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll">Lewis Caroll</a>

<li><p> Even Hilbert had only a few tricks!

<li><p> It is not sufficient to know whether there is a river beyond the mountain; it does remain to cross this river! 
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Arnold">Vladimir Arnold</a>
<br /><br />

</p>
</li>
<li><p> Mathematics is not abstract, by which I mean that it isn't a fictional model of something real ... Linear algebra isn't a model of something. It exists in itself, and in that sense it is real, not abstract, in the same way that music is real.

<li><p> It is stupid to claim that birds are better than frogs because they see farther, or that frogs are better than birds because they see deeper. The world of mathematics is both broad and deep, and we need birds and frogs working together to explore it.
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200902/rtx090200212p.pdf">Freeman Dyson</a> 
<br /><br />
</p>
</li>







<li><p> By concentrating on <i>what</i>, and leaving out <i>why</i>, mathematics is reduced to an empty shell.
The art is not in the "truth" but in the explanation, the argument. It is the argument itself which
gives the truth its context, and determines what is really being said and meant. Mathematics is
the art of explanation. If you deny students the opportunity to engage in this activity - to pose
their own problems, make their own conjectures and discoveries, to be wrong, to be creatively
frustrated, to have an inspiration, and to cobble together their own explanations and proofs - you
deny them mathematics itself. So no, I’m not complaining about the presence of facts and
formulas in our mathematics classes, I’m complaining about the lack of <i>mathematics</i> in our
mathematics classes.

<li><p>  I'm often reluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it. And if I don't run for several days, I feel ill. It's the same with people who do great things. They know they'll feel bad if they don't work, and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and discipline is no longer necessary. Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently trying to write Great Literature? Of course not. He was having fun. That's why he's so good.
<br /></p>
If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question. The critical moment for Einstein was when he looked at Maxwell's equations and said, what the hell is going on here?
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html">Paul Graham</a>

<br /></p>
</li>
<br /><br />
<li><p>  The great thing about tenure is that it means your research can be driven by your actual interests instead of the ever-changing winds of fashion. The problem is, by the time many people get tenure, they've become such slaves of fashion that they no longer know what it means to follow their own interests. They've spent the best years of their life trying to keep up with the Joneses instead of developing their own personal style! So, bear in mind that getting tenure is only half the battle: getting tenure while keeping your soul is the really hard part.
<br /></p>
To do this, you have to make sure you never lose that raw naive curiosity that got you interested in science in the first place. Don't get too wrapped up seriousness. The universe is a cool place; exploring it is fun! ... 
<br /></p>
So: keep playing around with all sorts of ideas, techniques and tools. Read voraciously. Don't be scared of experts and their jargon. Become one yourself, but then give the game away by explaining things in simple language whenever possible. Talk to lots of people! Teach them; learn from them; don't worry too much about impressing them. Don't be scared to ask basic questions -- and don't be surprised when nobody knows the answers. The simplest questions are the last to be answered.
